# Development plan

## 1. Read files:
    - Custom class and functions.
    - Requires extracting file metadata following a pydantic model definition.
    - File versioning supported: versioning is platform specific.

## 2.- Loadding and parsing documents:
    - Document is the content of a given file.
    - Document versioning might be different from file version.
    - Document metadata is different and follows a different model.

## 3.- Data conversion and chunking:
    - Data format interconversion.
    - Element extraction from documents: text, tables, and images.
    - Splitting and Indexing document elements.
